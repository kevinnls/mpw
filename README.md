### LICENSING
the code is public. but it is unlicensed and 100% under
my copyright. this means you are legally not allowed to
reuse this code.

the reason for this is that i plan on refining some of
these compoments as complete individual products as i
go. and i don't want to have clashing licenses. so this
entire repo will not be licensed for reuse.

if you still want to take any of these components and
build upon it, contact me on [twitter/kevinnlsamuel](//twitter.com/kevinnlsamuel)
